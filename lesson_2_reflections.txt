What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a hidden files that will contain data about the files in your directory. it will enable making commits and tracking history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediary stage in making commits. unlike the working directory, it is a part of git. it helps seperate commits by logical connections. it helps seperating the files in the repository if they don't all have to be saved at the same time.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By comparing thw working directory, staging area and most recent commit to see exactly what has been changed, and monitoring commits per logical change by adding just the specific change to the staging area.
