When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with other people, or from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you might not have a fully operational file there and you don't want it to be on your local directory before having completed it.
