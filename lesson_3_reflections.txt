When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with other people, or from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you might not have a fully operational file there and you don't want it to be on your local directory before having completed it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

I would use forks to make changes to somebody else's repository without changing his version. Clones are good for getting a copy of a repository and branches when i need to split my work or try an angle i am not ceratin about.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can access it offline and get in-sync.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Probably using emails and sending the new files each time. Git and github are easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

when working with other people, you might prefer to work on a seperate branch and later merge into master when you have everybody's changes.
Working like this makes it more organized as a team effort, while working on the master branch is more convenient for the individual.
